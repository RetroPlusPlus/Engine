// Sprite-path preamble — the sprite-variant counterpart to retropp_effect.hlsli. A generated sprite-custom
// variant (gen_shader.cmake SPRITE mode) injects this at sprite.frag's `@retropp:sprite-custom-hook` marker
// so a game's custom body (main → retroppCustomMain) runs INLINE in the sprite fragment — zero added render
// passes, N-flat in the sprite count. The custom body samples through sampleSource() and reads its own params
// exactly as on the layer path; the only differences the sprite path imposes are provided here:
//
//   * sampleSource(uv) reads the SPRITE'S OWN ART (the infinite transparent field via retroppSpriteArtSample),
//     not a composited frame. A Layer-scope custom effect transforms the sprite's own pixels; a custom that
//     must read the composited SCENE beneath the sprite is a Below-scope effect (a separate, scene-facing path).
//   * The art read is nearest at art-pixel granularity, so there is no compose-grid quantization — the engine
//     cbuffer values are sprite-path constants and paramRow / paramRowAtUv return 0 (no row table on the sprite
//     path). A shader that reads SourceTexture / RowDataTexture DIRECTLY (bypassing sampleSource) can't compile
//     as a sprite variant — those registers are the sprite's atlas / palette stores — so it declares
//     // @retropp:no-sprite and stays off the sprite path.
//   * Params are float-typed (float / float2 / float3 / float4); a shader whose cbuffer carries an int / uint
//     field gets no sprite variant (the sprite-effect store is a float texture; float values round-trip
//     bit-exact, arbitrary integer bit patterns risk denormal flush). Layer / Below use of that shader is
//     unaffected.
//
// The sprite context (gSprite*) this reads is published by sprite.frag's main() before the effect loop; this
// block is injected AFTER retroppSpriteArtSample so sampleSource resolves it.

// Per-fragment evaluation context (set by the generated wrapper before the body runs; the standard preamble's
// retroppTrueUv / retroppEvalUv). On the sprite path the body evaluates at the within-sprite quad coordinate
// directly (the art read is already nearest), so the two coincide.
