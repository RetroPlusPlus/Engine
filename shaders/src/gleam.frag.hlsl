// Gleam post-process fragment — a BUILT-IN engine effect stage. A luminance-keyed diagonal sheen sweep:
// a soft band leaning along the axis d = uv.x + uv.y·slant multiplies each pixel by its OWN brightness at
// the band crest (plus a white lift scaled by that brightness), so bright content catches the light and
// dark stays dark — the marquee/logo "shine". The whole contribution scales by `gain`, so gain == 0 is an
// exact identity. The unit-tested CPU mirror is retropp::applyGleam (postprocess.h). Engine stage contract
// (identical to displace/ripple/colorfill): one sampled source in space2 (t0/s0), one uniform cbuffer in
// space3 (b0); the shared fullscreen-triangle postprocess.vert is the vertex stage.
