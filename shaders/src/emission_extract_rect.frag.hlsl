// Rect-instanced emission extract fragment shader (below-scope fields) — engine-internal.
//
// The scene-sourced sibling of emission_extract.frag. That one runs fullscreen for the frame-class chain;
// this one runs over ONE FIELD'S RECT in the emission atlas, so a layer's below lenses extract together in
// a single instanced draw and their fields sit in the same atlas the region path packs into.
//
// The rect is a VIEWPORT-grid image: an atlas texel is a viewport cell, and `offset` carries that texel
// back to the viewport position it holds (retropp::emissionRectEntry writes the same offset the read
// applies, so the texel a fragment reads is the texel this pass wrote). The accumulator is a
// COMPOSE-resolution image, so the cell's centre scales up by uComposeScale and point-samples there — the
// analytic evaluation point, and the blur that follows band-limits whatever a point sample aliases.
//
// The whole rect is filled, margin ring included — NOT just the content box. A below halo is scene-sourced,
// so light just OUTSIDE a lens's quad is real light that belongs in its halo, and the ring is where a tap
// from the quad's edge lands. (The region path's raster leaves its ring at zero for the opposite reason:
// there the light is the sprite's own art, which does not extend past the quad.) The packer's margin is
// what keeps a tap inside the rect it started in, so a ring carrying this field's own light reaches no
// neighbour.
//
// The extract is NEUTRAL — intensity 1, white tint — because one field serves lenses of differing strength
// and colour; each record applies its own as it samples. That is why neither appears here.
//
// SDL_GPU HLSL conventions: the fragment's sampled texture + sampler in space2, the uniform buffer in
// space3.
//   - t0 space2 : the accumulator (the scene beneath this layer), SAMPLED (nearest, CLAMP)
//   - s0 space2 : its sampler — CLAMP, so a rect hanging off the frame extends the border rather than
//                 punching a hole of black into the halo
//   - b0 space3 : compose scale

// `emission()` body + its scene-reading sampleSource (retropp_emission_rect_effect.hlsli) + a record-lane param
// loader, and #defines RETROPP_EMISSION_RECT_CUSTOM so main() dispatches to it. On the base (stock) pipeline
// this is a sentinel — the stock brightpass / glow path below runs instead, and `read.w` is the 0/1 Bloom/Glow
// flag; on a custom pipeline `read.w` carries the fx record ROW the wrapper loads params from. `sceneUv` is the
// scene position this rect texel holds, `viewportDim` the viewport size (the displacement quantization unit),
// `ri` the lens's Custom record row.
