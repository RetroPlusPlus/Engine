// ColorSaturation post-process fragment — a BUILT-IN engine effect stage. A cross-channel colour grade: each
// pixel is pulled toward its own luminance, so uSaturation == 1 is an exact identity, 0 is greyscale, and
// values between desaturate. The identity is byte-exact — at uSaturation == 1 the amount is 0, so the
// multiply-by-zero + subtract-zero returns the source colour unchanged (the same structural exactness Gleam's
// gain == 0 has). The unit-tested CPU mirror is retropp::applySaturation (postprocess.h), sharing Gleam's
// Rec. 601 luma weights so the engine has one luminance authority. Engine stage contract (identical to
// gleam/colorfill): one sampled source in space2 (t0/s0), one uniform cbuffer in space3 (b0); the shared
// fullscreen-triangle postprocess.vert is the vertex stage.
