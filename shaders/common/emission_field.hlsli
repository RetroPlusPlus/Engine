//
// REQUIRES the includer to have already declared uEmissionRects, uEmissionAtlas, uEmissionSampler,
// uComposeScale, uEvalSnap and kEmissionSampleSteps, so this header is included AFTER the shader's
// resource and cbuffer declarations.
//
// This is the GPU mirror of retropp::emissionFieldSamplePoint (postprocess.h), which is the CPU
// authority — the two must move together.

// On the Viewport grid the point snaps to the cell centre, so the read is crisp; on the Output grid it stays
// continuous and the halo resolves smoothly between stored texels. Quantizing to kEmissionSampleSteps per
// texel makes the crisp case exact on every backend rather than dependent on each one's subtexel precision;
// round-half-up is the form that matches the CPU mirror, because HLSL round() is round-to-even and would
// disagree at a tie.
//
// The point is held inside the field's content box grown by one texel: the tap at the quad's edge draws from
// that ring, and emissionMargin sizes the rect so the ring holds this field's own light and no neighbour's. The
// clamp also covers the one degenerate case — if the atlas could not be allocated the layer binds the 1×1
// stand-in and a one-row table, whose zeroes collapse every read to a single transparent texel, so a step that
// named a field adds no light instead of reading somewhere arbitrary.
