// Where appended store content lands, and how much room a store texture is given.

// appends to the end and writes only what it appended. These decide the destination rectangle for that
// write, and how large a store texture is allocated when it has to be recreated. Engine-internal, and
// pure: a wrong rectangle writes correct bytes to the wrong place without failing, so the arithmetic is
// decided in one place and exercised on its own.
