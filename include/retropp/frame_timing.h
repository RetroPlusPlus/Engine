// invoking the render callback; the renderer reads here at the top of renderFrame. SDL-free, so the run
// loop stays SDL-free.
//
// Scoped to the calling thread (the single-threaded loop publishes and renders on the same thread). A
// thread whose loop has not published yet reads the default (alpha 0, tickAdvanced false) — which the
// renderer composites as the submission verbatim, the correct first-frame behaviour.
