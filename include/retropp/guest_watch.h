// Where a hosted machine's own reads and writes are decided by the game's native code.
//
// A watch is keyed on an ACCESS: when the guest reads or writes a byte of the declared place, native
// code runs and says what that access does. Reach for a watch when the interesting thing is a place
// in memory, whichever instruction touches it; reach for an escape (guest_escape.h) when it is a
// place in the code.
//
// Watches are declared as ONE batch and the machine checks every entry when the batch is registered,
// so a table is answered once rather than one failure at a time during play — the same shape as
// registerRegions and registerEscapes. A watch names a place with MemoryRegion, the same value the
// read/write verbs name places with, bank-qualified where the console needs it (gb::banked).
//
// WHAT A HANDLER ANSWERS WITH. Each handler returns an AccessVerdict: proceed() lets the access
// happen as the cartridge intended, instead(v) substitutes a byte, and veto() prevents a write. The
// decision is made PER ACCESS, inside the handler, so a condition that changes ("freeze this only
// while the shield is up") is a branch in one handler rather than a watch armed and disarmed from
// the game thread every time the condition moves.
//
// TWO DIRECTIONS, DECLARED SEPARATELY. A watch declares .onRead, .onWrite, or both — at least one,
// or the entry is refused by its key. Each handler answers one question, so veto() reads clearly on
// the write side, and declaring only the direction you want is what keeps the machine cheap: the
// platform arms that direction alone, and a memory access is the hottest path a machine has.
//
// A handler fires SYNCHRONOUSLY ON THE THREAD THAT STEPS THE MACHINE, mid-instruction, with the
// machine parked at the access. It is handed the machine, so it reads declared places, calls the
// cartridge's own routines through bindRoutine, and declares or switches escapes and watches of its
// own, to any depth. Whatever a handler touches, the handler owns the thread-safety of.
//
// This is the primitive; what a game builds on it is the game's.

// running inside a bindRoutine call, because that is still the guest executing. What is declarable
// is whether the GAME's own deliberate read/write verbs go through the watch too: a game whose logic
// keys off writes may want its own writes to drive that logic as well.
//
// The platform's own stores are never watched under either value — seeding a booted image, planting a
// return landing, and the store that realizes instead(v) on a write. Those are the platform acting on
// the machine, rather than the machine accessing itself.
