// ── Emission atlas planning — where each field's blurred image lives ─────────────────────────────────
//
// A field is a blurred image sized to its consumer's footprint rather than to the viewport, and many
// fields share one atlas texture. The planner decides where each one goes, such that a field's blur can
// never read a neighbour's content.
//
// That isolation is per-rect, not pairwise. A field's rect is its consumer's quad grown by a margin of
// ceil(reach) + 1 on every side, and a field is only ever READ inside that quad — the inner box. A texel
// of the inner box sits at least `m` from its own rect's edge while a blur tap travels at most
// reach < m, so no tap leaves the rect it started in, in either pass, whatever is packed next door.
// Texels out in the margin ring may well pick up a neighbour's light; nothing reads them. Rects
// therefore pack adjacently, which is what makes many small fields at a wide reach affordable.
//
// Fields group into pages by reach. Every field on a page blurs with the same kernel, so one horizontal
// and one vertical pass serve the whole page however many rects sit on it — passes track the number of
// distinct reaches authored, never the field count.

// What one field needs: where its consumer sits in viewport pixels, and how far its light spreads.
struct EmissionDemand {

    float reach = 0.0f;                // viewport px
};
