// Thrown when a stored document cannot be trusted: a corrupt or truncated envelope, a
// schema version newer than the code understands, or a gap in the registered migration
// chain. Deliberately distinct from an ABSENT document (read returns std::nullopt): a
// corrupt save surfacing as "no save" would silently discard the player's data, so the
// two conditions never share a signal.
class SaveStoreError : public std::runtime_error {
public:

// The platform's per-user data directory for `identity` — `%APPDATA%\<org>\<app>` on Windows,
// `~/Library/Application Support/<org>/<app>` on macOS, `$XDG_DATA_HOME/<org>/<app>` on Linux. This is
// the directory a default-constructed SaveStore writes into, named so a game can place its OTHER
// per-user files beside its saves instead of resolving a second directory of its own.
//
// Throws SaveStoreError when either identity field is empty (an unconfigured identity has no correct
// directory, and a fallback would collide every unconfigured game into one) or when the platform cannot
// supply a directory. The error type is the persistence one because this IS the persistence directory;
// the two cannot disagree about where a player's files live, since SaveStore resolves through here.
//
// Resolving the directory creates it if absent — the platform call does that, and it is what makes the
// path immediately writable. Nothing inside it is created.

// A durable, versioned store of named byte documents — the persistence primitive beneath
// game saves and settings. Each document is an opaque byte payload tagged with a
// consumer-defined schema version; the store never interprets the payload. What the store
// owns is everything around the bytes:
//
//   * WHERE — a default-constructed store resolves the platform-correct per-user data
//     directory from EngineConfig::active.identity (%APPDATA%\<org>\<app> on Windows,
//     ~/Library/Application Support/<org>/<app> on macOS, $XDG_DATA_HOME/<org>/<app> on
//     Linux), once, at construction. SaveStore::atPath roots a store at an explicit
//     directory instead — the seam tests use to stay hermetic, and the way to place
//     documents anywhere else deliberately.
//
//   * DURABILITY — write() is atomic: the document is written to a sibling temp file,
//     flushed to disk, then moved over the target in one filesystem rename. A crash at
//     any point mid-write leaves the previous document intact; a document on disk is
//     always a complete one. A failed write returns false with the prior bytes untouched.
//
//   * VERSIONING — every document carries its consumer schema version in a fixed,
//     endian-stable envelope, so a file written on one platform reads on any other.
//
//   * MIGRATION — the consumer declares its current version and registers one step per
//     version bump (each step transforms version v payload bytes into version v+1 payload
//     bytes). read() walks an older document through the steps in order and returns the
//     payload already current. The step logic — like the payload format itself — belongs
//     entirely to the consumer; the store orchestrates the walk, rejects files newer than
//     the declared current version, and rejects a chain with a missing step.
//
// Document names are flat identifiers ("slot1", "settings"), not paths: a name containing
// a path separator, a drive designator, or naming "." / ".." throws std::invalid_argument,
// so a document can never land outside the store's directory. Two stores at different base
// directories are fully independent; the store holds no global state.
//
// Persistence is a synchronous main-thread call, like the rest of the engine surface.
