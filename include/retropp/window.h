// change what they report, unlike a window-relative cursor position).

//   MotionSource::Dpad        — the d-pad's unit vector
//
// `motion` is the COMPLETE set — specifying it replaces the default wholesale, so a set without
// Pointer means the mouse does not drive this drag (a stick-cursor interface names the stick the
// cursor is NOT on). WindowMovement::None is the OFF value: declaring it turns automatic movement

// The one window, as an object — returned by platform.window() (the platform is single-window by
// design; multiple windows are separate renderers). Noun setter/getter pairs; a setter is a no-op
// unless its value differs from the last one set through this surface, and it touches nothing else,
// so repeated calls never re-assert window state against a native drag or a user resize.
//
// Two complementary paths move the window, one declaration each:
//
//   • NATIVE — dragHandles({...}): a real mouse press inside any declared region hands the window to
//     the OS window manager, which performs the drag (pixel-perfect, zero per-frame work).
//   • AUTOMATIC — autoMove(movement): while the declared trigger action is held, the window follows
//     the declared motion sources (update() applies the per-frame delta). The path for gamepad-driven
//     interfaces, where no OS mouse press exists to hit-test.
//
// A drag handle IS a drawn Region: the game builds its title bar as a Region, draws it in its frame,

// by construction. Containment matches the drawn region exactly (the region gate's CPU mirror, curve
