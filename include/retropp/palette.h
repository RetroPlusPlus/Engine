// The faithful GB/C colour model: tile art is INDICES (0..N-1), and the colour comes from a
// palette selected at render time — never baked into the art. An indexed atlas holds one
// palette index per pixel; a palette maps each index to a final output colour; a tile picks
// which palette (within its layer's set) it draws from. Application happens per-pixel in the
// fragment shader, so palette swaps, day/night, and animation stay data/shader concerns —
// never a palette-RAM poke or scanline idiom.

// One palette entry: a final output colour. Identity is the named channels — never a
// positional quad. Default is opaque black. The platform stores Rgba8 output regardless of the
// source console; a palette's colours come from the game's assets at upload time.
