namespace retropp {

// Files a game keeps for one player, in the platform's per-user data directory — the same directory
// SaveStore writes into (userDataDir(), save_store.h). Extracted assets, screenshots, a cache, a log:
// anything that belongs to this player on this machine and is not a save document.
//
// SaveStore is the surface for documents the game must be able to READ BACK ACROSS VERSIONS — it wraps
// every payload in an envelope, tags it with a schema version, and walks old files forward through
// registered migrations. That machinery exists because a player's save has to survive the game changing
// underneath it. A decoded tile sheet does not: it is bytes the game wrote and will read back verbatim,
// and re-deriving it is cheaper than migrating it. So this store keeps the parts that are about the
// FILE — where it goes, and that a crash cannot leave half of one — and none of the parts about a
// document's life over time.
//
// What it keeps from SaveStore:
//
//   * WHERE — a default-constructed store roots at userDataDir(), resolved from the identity
//     EngineConfig::setActive() published. UserFiles::atPath roots at an explicit directory instead.
//     root() is the directory itself, which is what a game assigns to EngineConfig::assetRoot when its
//     assets live here.
//
//   * DURABILITY — write() is atomic: the bytes go to a sibling temp file, are flushed to the device,
//     then moved over the target in one filesystem rename. A crash mid-write leaves the previous file
//     intact, never a partial one.
//
// What it drops: the envelope, the schema version, and the migration chain. A file written here is
// exactly the bytes handed to write(), byte for byte, readable by any other program.
//
// Names ARE relative paths here, which is the other difference from SaveStore: "assets/tiles/00.png"
// names a file two directories down, and write() creates the directories on the way. A path that is
// absolute, names a drive, or contains a ".." component throws std::invalid_argument, so a file can
// never land outside the store's directory — the guarantee SaveStore gets by refusing separators
// outright, kept while allowing a tree.
//
// Two stores at different directories are fully independent; the store holds no global state. Like the
// rest of the platform surface, these are synchronous main-thread calls.
