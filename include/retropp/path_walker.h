// ── Path walking: PathPacing + PathWalker ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The movement-player layer over a curve, completing the data→player family: where AnimationPlayer
// resolves elapsed ticks → a frame and TweenPlayer resolves elapsed ticks → a value, PathWalker resolves
// elapsed ticks → a POSITION and a FACING along a curve. The geometry (Curve / ArcLengthTable) answers
// "where is arc-length s, and which way does travel point there"; it carries no clock. Time enters the
// geometry HERE, and only here — as a pacing driver that converts elapsed ticks into a distance along the
// path. The engine provides the pure stateless resolver (sampleWalk, the analogue of sampleAnimation / sampleTween);
// the game owns the cursor (PathWalker) and writes the resolved position + facing into whatever it likes.
//
// A walker is content-agnostic: it returns raw Vec2 geometry and never touches a Sprite. A camera on a
// track, a projectile arc, a particle, or a UI rail all use it bare.

// ── PathPacing: the time → distance driver ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

// How a walker converts elapsed time into a distance along its curve. Three forms, authored via the
// engine's named-constructor idiom (the PlaybackMode / TimingProfile preset shape); identity is the kind,
// the first member:
//   Speed         — constant speed, in viewport pixels per SECOND (wall time; resolved to px/tick via the
//                   walker's TimingProfile, so the same value means the same on-screen speed on any
//                   cadence).
//   Eased         — one full traversal takes `duration`, shaped by `easing` (the Tween / Easing curve
//                   set): distance = length × ease(easing, t / duration).
//   DistanceTween — a game-owned Tween<float> IS the distance-vs-time function, so a multi-segment
//                   profile can accelerate, pause, and even move BACKWARD along the path (a non-monotone
//                   distance track, clamped to [0, length]).

// THE pure resolver — the single point of movement truth (PathWalker is the stateful wrapper over it), the
// sampleWalk analogue of sampleAnimation / sampleTween. Takes the baked table by const ref (pure functions own nothing);
// position = table.atDistance(s) and facing = table.tangentAtDistance(s) — the pair that always agrees.
//
// Per pacing kind, under the reused PlaybackMode (loop = wrap the DISTANCE — continuous on a closed curve,
// a sawtooth snap-back on an open one, the same wrap sampleTween has; a there-and-back is authored as a
// DistanceTween yoyo, never a mode):
//   Speed         — raw = pxPerTick × elapsedTicks; LoopIndefinitely wraps with fmod (never finished),
//                   Single holds `length` once raw ≥ length, LoopNTimes(n) holds `length` after n passes,
//                   PlayForDuration(d) holds the distance shown at the cutoff. Speed 0 stays parked at 0.
//   Eased         — durTicks = one pass; the mode wraps/holds TICKS exactly as sampleTween does, then
//                   s = length × ease(easing, posInPass / durTicks). The eased endpoints are pinned.
//   DistanceTween — pass-through: s = clamp(sampleTween(*distance, …).value, 0, length); the tween's own
//                   wrap / hold / zero-segment semantics ARE the contract. A null pointer is the parked
//                   default (s = 0; finished for the finite modes, not for a loop).
// LoopNTimes(0) rests at the START (s = 0), finished — a walker that never played sits where it started.
// Degenerate geometry (empty table or length 0): position at the start, zero facing, distance 0, finished
// for the finite modes and not for LoopIndefinitely (the mirror of sampleTween's total-0 case).
