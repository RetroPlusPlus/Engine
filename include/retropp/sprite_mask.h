// The sprite MASK family — a sprite's image as a MASK, decoupled from the texture that defined it. A
// Sprite always carries a texture and draws it; the mask is the coverage alone, usable anywhere a shape
// is usable — test points against it (pixel-exact collision), or take it as geometry to drive a
// textureless Region in the shape of the sprite. Three forms, in whichever coordinate Space you ask for:
//   sprite.mask(space)          → SpriteMask       — a BORROW: exact, live, non-owning (frame life)
//   sprite.freezeMask(space)    → FrozenSpriteMask — OWNED: an exact snapshot, detached, storable
//   sprite.maskShape(n, space)  → ShapePoints      — OWNED: the mask as GEOMETRY, a coarse ≤ n-point
//                                                    polygon (a real shape — Region / stencil() / physics)
// Every form reads the sprite's CURRENT tile — re-query after a frame change. The coverage is the
// sprite's own sheet, resolved from `atlas` against the uploaded pixels. The point/orientation/placement
// math is CPU-only, tick-state (the same discipline the anchors follow).
//
// The cost model — the intuition is inverted: exactness is expensive to DRAW, not to test.
//   - The exact forms answer contains(point) with ONE coverage read, O(1) — no polygon. A ShapePoints
//     test is O(vertices). The coarse polygon is not the fast mask; it is the differently-USABLE one.
//   - A DRAWN polygon's vertex count is a per-pixel cost while it is on screen (the region gate
//     evaluates the polygon SDF per fragment; it carries at most 64 vertices — longer polygons truncate
//     at pack time with a logged warning).
//   - freezeMask() copies the coverage mask on every call — per-frame-per-object use is allocation
//     churn plus retained memory. maskShape() traces the coverage on every call — cache the result.
// To re-draw the sprite's ART, the mask is the wrong tool: a second Sprite with the same atlas / tile /
// transform is one instanced quad (a whole-silhouette ColorFill flat-colours it). That covers re-drawing
// the art and nothing else — it cannot give a textureless region, a detached shape, or an evenly
// inflated outline (ShapePoints::radius can).
