// ── Sprite paths: SpritePath, the movement orchestrator ─────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// One game-owned cursor that drives a sprite along a route while it rotates, scales, and animates — the
// player one level up from PathWalker. Where PathWalker resolves elapsed ticks → a position + facing and
// nothing else, SpritePath composes that movement with concurrent rotation and scale tracks, a frame
// animation, and a facing policy, all off ONE elapsed-tick clock, and writes the composed result into a
// Sprite. It is the movement analogue of the whole player family: pure-data content (SpritePathNode) plus a
// pure resolver internally, wrapped in a game-owned cursor whose state lives in the game's object, not the
// engine. The renderer never sees it.
//
// A path plays a SEQUENCE of nodes back-to-back: each node names where it travels, how fast, which way it
// faces, and the tracks that run alongside the move. Node i's movement, when it authors no origin, departs
// from node i−1's end — a patrol route is a chain of legs. A sequence-level PlaybackMode (passed to
// advance()) decides what happens after the last node: loop, rest, N laps, or play-for-a-duration. On top of
// the base sequence sits the interrupt stack — suspend the whole current playback, run a detour departing
// from where the sprite stands, and resume EXACTLY where it left off when the detour finishes.

// ── SpritePathMove: where a node travels ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

// A declarative movement spec. It is resolved to a Curve when its node is entered — origin is only known
// then, so it defaults to wherever the chain hands off (the path's start, or the previous node's end).
// Named constructors are the authoring surface; aggregate initialization stays available and
// interchangeable. Identity is the kind, the first member.

// One node: a movement spec + pacing + the concurrent tracks. PURE DATA — the SpritePath cursor owns all
// runtime state and resolves each track via the pure resolvers (tweenAt / playbackAt) against a NODE-LOCAL
// clock (ticks since the node was entered), so a node is a self-contained scene that replays whole on every
// entry. A tween track is held BY VALUE (a node is self-contained, copyable, with no lifetime coupling); the
// Animation is BY POINTER (a shared asset the game owns, valid for the cursor's lifetime), as is the
// DistanceTween a pacing may carry.
//
// Two idioms fall out of the pacing kinds, both kept deliberately:
//   • The WAIT node  — a zero-length move (Move::to the same point) with Eased pacing: the node stays entered
//                      for the eased duration while the sprite stands still and its tracks play.
//   • The SENTINEL node — Speed 0 (the parked default) on nonzero geometry never finishes: the sequence rests
//                      there indefinitely, tracks playing, until an interrupt or a re-path moves it on.
