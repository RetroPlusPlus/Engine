// Where a hosted machine's own code hands control to the game's native code, and what runs when it
// does.
//
// A game declares the places it wants to intercept as ONE batch and the machine checks every entry
// when the batch is registered, so a table of escapes is answered once rather than one failure at a
// time during play — the same shape as registerRegions. An escape names a place with the machine's
// own vocabulary, bank-qualified where the console needs it (gb::banked), exactly as MemoryRegion.at
// does.
//
// WHAT AN ESCAPE DOES, PRECISELY. When the machine is about to execute the instruction at `at`, the
// handler runs to completion first; the instruction then executes, exactly once, whatever the handler
// did. The handler runs on the host's clock, and the guest's clock stands still for it, so a machine
// with escapes holds the same cadence as one without.
//
// The handler receives the machine, so it reads and writes declared places while it runs. It fires
// SYNCHRONOUSLY ON THE THREAD THAT STEPS THE MACHINE: for a machine the game drives, that is the
// game's own call; for a machine running on its own thread (Vm::run), that thread. Whatever a handler
// touches, the handler owns the thread-safety of.
//
// REPLACING A ROUTINE is the other kind of escape: `.replaces = routine(binding, fn)` declares that a
// native function ANSWERS INSTEAD of the routine at `at` — while the escape is live the guest never
// executes that routine's body, and switching it off or removing it puts the routine back exactly as
// it was. The binding transcribes the calling convention the routine already has in the cartridge
// (where its callers leave the arguments, where they expect the answer), and the platform marshals both
// directions synchronously while the machine is parked at the entry — so the caller reads a correct
// answer in the same step, in the register or memory its own code was written to read. See vm.h's
// routine(...) for the declaration and the direction the values flow.
