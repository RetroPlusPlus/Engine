// The in-tree static-library consumer for the registry link surface.
//
// The three build scans (shaders, assets, routines) read a target's sources for registration calls and
// emit one generated registry translation unit per kind. Those TUs are pure static initializers, so a
// static library needs a linker anchor to keep them (retropp_anchor_registry in CMakeLists.txt). This
// library is the shape that proves it: the paths below are baked into ITS archive, and
// registry_linkage_test.cpp — linked into the test executable alongside it — asserts each one arrives.
//
// Nothing here runs. The scans read call sites textually, so the registrations happen at build time; a
// Renderer and a Vm are named only to make the calls compile. Each path is used by no other target, so a
// passing assertion cannot be satisfied by some other target's bake.
