// How the mix treats a machine that is behind, and how far ahead of the mix a machine may get.
//
// While the output holds more than its floor there is time to wait, so a pass takes only what every
// machine has ready and comes back for the rest. Once the output is down to that floor the pass
// advances by what the most-advanced voice produced; a voice with fewer contributes silence for the
// shortfall and that shortfall is counted against it, so a machine that falls behind mutes itself and
// nothing else, and its late frames still play — after a gap, intact.
//
// Ahead of the mix, a machine runs only until its lane and the output buffer together hold the latency
// target, so a machine on its own thread parks the output's own inventory and nothing further.
//
// Device-free where it can be: CaptureAudioSink + the internal synchronous seam, whose selective
// stepping advances one voice at a time. Stepping the voices unevenly is what produces a short lane
// deterministically, without waiting on a real machine to fall behind a real one. The pacing runs on a
// machine's own thread, so the case that pins it does too.
