// find them somewhere other than the call site.
//
// `AudioLibrary::registerDriver` takes a `HostedDriverBinding`, and that binding is normally its own
// variable — so the registerDriver statement carries a variable name and no path. The paths live in the
// `DriverImagePath` initializers inside the binding, each with its own `.policy`, and a binding routinely
// mixes them: an Embed boot image beside a LoadFromPath one that must never end up inside the binary.
//
// An image may also be given as inline BYTES, which carry no path for the scan to read. Such an image is
// invisible to the build by construction, and the cases at the bottom hold that: its neighbours resolve
// exactly as they would without it, and nothing of it reaches any registry.
//
// The declarations under test are in tests/registry_linkage/, whose two bindings carry every case. What
// is asserted here is what the build did with them — an image resolving to Embed has bytes in the
// registry its extension selects, and the LoadFromPath one has none anywhere.
