// Guest-nesting demo — native code calls the cartridge's own routines, in the guest's own context.
//
// An escape lets guest code hand control to this program. This is the other half of the same seam:
// this program calling INTO the guest, at any depth, and leaving the machine exactly as it found it.
// Two acts:
//
//   * ANSWERING WITH THE CARTRIDGE'S OWN CODE. The cartridge is authored right here, every byte of
//     it this file's own, its program assembled by the engine's own SM83 assembler. Its loop asks
//     its own damage routine for a number every frame. A replacement answers that routine natively
//     — and builds its answer by calling the cartridge's OWN generator, nested inside the escape,
//     while the machine runs on its own thread at hardware cadence. The damage the guest reads is
//     this program's rule over the cartridge's own randomness, and the generator's seed advances in
//     the guest's memory exactly as the cartridge intended.
//   * READING WHAT THE GAME NEVER REACHED. Then the machine is parked, and this program calls the
//     cartridge's own decompressor on a packed table the running loop never touches — content that
//     only the cartridge's own code knows how to unpack, obtained without playing the game to it.
//
// Headless: no window, no GPU, no audio device. Safe to run anywhere, including over SSH.
//
// With --verify the demo asserts what it observes — that the nested generator ran once per answer,
// that the seed advanced in step, that the damage is this program's rule over the guest's number,
// and that the decoder unpacked the table — and exits nonzero on any violation.
