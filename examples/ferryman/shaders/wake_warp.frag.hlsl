// A moving thing leaves a trail of warped space behind it that refracts the WHOLE VIEW beneath it —
// an animated wavy displacement of the sampled image, like a heat-haze wake. The game runs this on
// a content-less layer JUST BELOW the moving sprite at BELOW scope (so it distorts everything under
// it, never the sprite itself), confined to a trailing capsule behind the mover via a Region.
//
// `warpChroma` is the switch: 0 = pure distortion (the ferry's clean wake); > 0 = ALSO cycle the
// hue of the refracted view, animated + position-varying, for the mutant's PSYCHEDELIC trail (a
// luma-preserving rotation about the grey axis, blended in by warpChroma). The engine injects the
// plumbing (sampleSource + the cbuffer packer); this file declares its own params + body.
