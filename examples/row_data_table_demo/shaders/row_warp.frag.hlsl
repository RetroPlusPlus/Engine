// Reads a per-scanline value the game cannot express as one sine: a hand-built, digitized per-line
// HORIZONTAL SCALE ramp, supplied through the effect's per-row data table (paramRowAtUv reads the row
// under this fragment). The x lane is the per-line scale about the screen centre, so each scanline
// stretches or squeezes horizontally by its own amount — a domed warp whose profile is whatever the
// game wrote into the table that frame. It samples through sampleSource(), so the edge policy is the
// effect's (Blank reveals what is behind; Stretch clamps). Slow drift, no strobe.
