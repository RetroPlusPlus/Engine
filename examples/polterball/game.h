// Polterball — the SIMULATION, its own translation unit. Owns the board, the ball, the paddle, the
// ghost squad, and the score/lives/ignite state, and advances them one 60 Hz tick from the input.
// It draws nothing and makes no sound: it NAMES what happened each tick as a GameEvent stream, which
// the audio + feel layers consume. Pure game model.
//
// THE LOOP (the hybrid's emergent core):
//   • The ball is the pellet-eater — it eats every corridor pellet it ricochets across — and the
//     ghosts hunt THE BALL. You steer it only indirectly, through paddle english: every return is
//     both an aim and a lure.
//   • A ghost that touches the ball SWALLOWS it (a lost life, same stakes as dropping it past the
//     paddle). A power pellet IGNITES the ball for a few seconds: the ghosts turn and flee, and now
//     contact smashes THEM — bank-shot hunting, chain-scored.
//   • Soft walls break permanently when the ball carves them, reshaping both the bounce corridors
//     and the ghosts' routes for the rest of the board. Demolition is strategy, not decoration.
//   • Eat every pellet (power pellets included) to clear the board; the next board is faster.
