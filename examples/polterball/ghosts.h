// Polterball — the GHOST AI, its own translation unit. Three ghosts patrol the maze's cell grid and
// hunt THE BALL (never the player) with the classic junction rules:
//
//   • Movement is cell-centre to cell-centre. A ghost picks its next direction only when it arrives
//     at a cell centre, and it NEVER reverses except on a mode change — which is why the boards are
//     authored dead-end-free (a no-reverse ghost in a dead end would be stuck forever).
//   • The pick is GREEDY, not pathfinding: among the open non-reverse directions, take the one whose
//     next cell is straight-line closest to the target (tie order Up, Left, Down, Right).
//   • Personalities differ ONLY by target: the Chaser aims at the ball's cell, the Ambusher aims a
//     few cells AHEAD of the ball's velocity (it cuts corridors off), and the Wanderer picks randomly
//     at every junction (constant background pressure).
//   • A scatter/chase clock alternates hunting with a retreat to fixed home corners, so the pressure
//     breathes. The clock pauses while the ball is ignited.
//   • Frightened (the ball ate a power pellet): random at junctions, slower, reversed on entry — the
//     hunters become the hunted. A downed ghost's EYES fly home to the pen along a smooth Curve
//     (baked once into an ArcLengthTable, walked at constant speed), then it respawns and exits.
//
// The squad only MOVES ghosts; the ball↔ghost contact rules (swallow vs down) live in the sim, which
// reads each ghost's position from here.
