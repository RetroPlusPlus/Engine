; tone_sustain — a self-contained CONTINUOUS pulse tone (CH2, ~512 Hz). Its envelope pace is 0, so the
; envelope is DISABLED and the volume stays constant — the tone plays forever once triggered and its output
; is never silent. For the auto-close NEGATIVE test: a still-sounding voice must NOT auto-close, even when
; tagged Sfx (the high-pass-centred square oscillates through 0 but never holds (0,0)).
