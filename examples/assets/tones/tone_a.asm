; tone_a — a complete, self-contained wave-channel (CH3) driver sounding A4 (~440 Hz). Every voice
; runs on its own fresh VM, so the driver carries its whole hardware setup — it never depends on
; another routine having configured the chip. Order matters for a clean start: the APU + wave RAM +
; DAC + volumes are set while the channel is UNTRIGGERED (silent — wave RAM is safe to write, the
; DAC-on step lands on silence), then one frame of settle lets the output centre before the single
; trigger starts the note cleanly (no pop rides the onset).
