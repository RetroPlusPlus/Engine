"""Author the ENG-2.H animation demo's numbered, single-colour indexed tileset.

The animation demo (examples/animation_demo.cpp) must let you SEE the difference between frame
animation and palette-cycling animation. The atlas-load demo's sheets bake a DIFFERENT hue into
each cell (cell 0 red, cell 1 orange, …), so an animation that merely advances the frame ALSO
appears to change colour — which makes frame animation indistinguishable from palette cycling.

This sheet fixes that: every cell uses the SAME two palette indices — index 0 background, index 1
the digit — and differs ONLY in the digit's SHAPE. So under one fixed palette the six numbered
cells are the same colour and differ only by their number (frame animation = the number changes,
colour constant), while holding one cell and swapping the palette recolours that single number
(palette cycling = colour changes, number constant). The numbers stay so the frame change is
visible either way.

These are engine-original images (no Crystal / Nintendo art). One-time authoring tool, kept
committed so the asset stays regenerable and its index plane is auditable — the same posture as
gen_atlas_demo_assets.py (whose minimal, Pillow-free PNG encoder this mirrors). It writes only its
own new asset; the atlas-load demo's assets and generator are left untouched (examples accumulate).

Dependency-free: a minimal 8-bit-palette PNG encoder over the standard library (zlib + struct).
